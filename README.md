What you need
--
- Raspberry Pi 0 W (I have not tested with the Pi 0 non-Wireless)
- Pi 0 W Camera Ribbon (comes with the Pi 0 camera case or you can buy somewhere else, the stock one that comes with the camera may not fit).
- Raspberry Pi Camera or Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera
- Micro SD card

What works and what doesn't
--
- The camera is known to work on Linux, Windows 10 and macOS Mojave.
- You can use the normal camera of the Pi, it will work too, of course it won't look too good.

Directions
--
- Assemble the camera to the Pi.
- Download the binary release (down below).
- Download and use Etcher to write the image to the SD card. 
- Use the USB data port (the one in the middle of the Pi, not the one on the edge) to connect to a computer.
- Enjoy!

Binary releases
--
Occasionally I release binary snapshots at the release tab: https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam/releases

Debugging
--
For debugging, a 115200 baud serial interface is provided as a ttyACM device:
- Please use screen or minicom to connect to it.
- Use username: `root`, password `root`.

Ubuntu example:
```
$ ll /dev/ttyACM*
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 sep 25 14:03 /dev/ttyACM0
$ screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

Also, there is a *untested* serial interface on the serial 40-pin header: https://pinout.xyz/pinout/uart

If you want to modify the image content the quick-and-dirty way (not recommended):
- Start with the `chroot-to-pi` script: https://gist.github.com/htruong/7df502fb60268eeee5bca21ef3e436eb
- Edit `/bin/bash` to `/bin/sh` on the `chroot /mnt/raspbian /bin/bash` line.

Building
--
Make a directory in your home: `develop`.

- In `develop`, untar the `buildroot-2020.2.3` tar package and rename `buildroot-2020.02.3` to `buildroot`. 
- Get out back to `develop`.
- In `develop`, `git clone` this repo `https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam` to it.
- Run `./build-showmewebcam.sh`.
- The resulting image will be at the `buildroot/output/image` folder.
